# flutter_download_manager

This package aims to provide a download manager that supports a hierarchical dependency system. It is being developed for [Finamp](https://github.com/UnicornsOnLSD/finamp) to allow for easier management of the downloaded song library. This package is in very early development, hence the lack of install guide or detailed API reference. When the package is ready, it will support Android and Darwin through their native download systems, and desktop via a generic Dart implementation.
